# üß† Demo Projects

A showcase of real-world builds‚Äîfrom AI-powered personal tools to rugged home security systems. All projects are fully functional, many developed from scratch, and optimized for real-time performance, privacy, or impact.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ![AI Chat Security Camera](ai-chat-security-camera.jpg) | **AI Chat Security Camera** ‚Äì An offline home surveillance system with a built-in LLM assistant. Enables natural language querying of events while maintaining full local data privacy. |
| ![LLM-Powered Reminders](llm-powered-reminders.gif) | **LLM Reminders & Timeboxer** ‚Äì AI agent that turns freeform notes into smart, scheduled reminders. Integrated with a draggable daily calendar for real-time prioritization and timeboxing. |
| ![Local LLM Chat Interface](local-llm-chat-interface.gif) | **Local LLM Chat UI** ‚Äì Custom React-based chat client for running private LLMs on-device. Features persistent chat history, Markdown support, and modern Messenger-style UI. |
| ![Thermal Capability for BLIP Home Security](thermal-capability-for-blip-home-security.png) | **BLIP Thermal Security** ‚Äì DIY thermal imaging add-on for BLIP home monitoring system. Built for sub-$100 setups using off-the-shelf monocles and clever lens alignment. |
| ![Timeboxing App](timeboxing-app.gif) | **Timeboxing App** ‚Äì A minimal, real-time task organizer that combines AI-prioritized reminders with a 15-minute interval calendar and auto-updating current time indicator. |

## üî≠ What Drives Me

I build systems that matter.

From FDA-cleared cancer diagnostics to global-scale e-commerce infrastructure, I specialize in transforming early-stage prototypes into reliable, compliant, and business-critical platforms. I lead with deep technical empathy and a product-first mindset.

> I believe engineering is a storytelling medium. My teams don‚Äôt just ship code ‚Äî we shape behavior, inform decisions, and deliver value at scale.

## üè• Making Health Tech Work in the Wild

I've led the engineering, design, and AI teams behind:
- **10+ mission-critical products** across healthcare, financial, and government sectors
- **6 FDA-cleared medical devices**, now in daily use at world-renowned hospitals
- AI integrations including **LLM summarization**, **diagnostic imaging**, and **personalized immunotherapy**

We‚Äôve gone from:
- 4-week release cycles ‚û°Ô∏è daily agile iterations  
- Legacy silos ‚û°Ô∏è Fully distributed cloud backends  
- Manual workflows ‚û°Ô∏è ML-assisted decision support tools

## üß¨ Scaling for Impact

I scale things ‚Äî systems, teams, and businesses.

- Led engineering orgs from **seed to acquisition** multiple times  
- Scaled platforms to support **100M+ daily users**  
- Drove monetization from MVP ‚û°Ô∏è $50M+ ARR  
- Built GTM-supporting Sales Engineering teams from scratch  
- Took delivery predictability from <10% ‚û°Ô∏è 99%+ across 4 teams  

I approach scaling as a design problem, not just a hiring one. Thoughtful architecture, strong culture, and fast feedback loops win every time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Some Technologies I Work With

**Core strengths:**  
- Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP  
- Infra: CDK, CloudFormation, CodeStar  
- Compliance: HIPAA, FDA 510k, GDPR  
- Languages: Python, C#, Node.js, C++, Java  
- AI/ML: Custom neural nets, LLMs, diagnostic imaging pipelines  
- Tooling: GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Sentry, Terraform  

I combine strong architecture chops with an understanding of regulatory environments ‚Äî rare but essential in healthtech and govtech.
